The Miele integration allows users to integrate their home appliances using the [official 3rd party API](https://www.miele.com/developer). The integration will make the best effort to map the data-points in the API to sensors, switches, etc. in Home Assistant.

## Use cases

- Monitor the multiple sensors of the appliance and trigger automations based on these sensors.
- Monitor the program status of the appliances.

{% note %}
Note that the feature availability depends on the appliance model.
{% endnote %}

## Supported devices

You can find information about supported devices on the [Miele website](https://www.miele.com/developer/capabilities.html).

## Prerequisites

1. Visit [https://www.miele.com/developer](https://www.miele.com/f/com/en/register_api.aspx) and sign up for a developer account.
2. Enter an arbitrary name for your connection and the email of your login for the original Miele app.
3. On success, you will get an email with an activation link. Press the Activate button. Make note of the client ID and secret - you will need them for the next step.
4. In Home Assistant, find the Miele integration and launch it. You will be prompted to create an [Application Credential](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/application_credentials). You will need to provide a name (it's arbitrary) in addition to the Client ID and Secret from the previous step. Then, follow the steps in the UI to complete setup.

{% important %}

- The provided Miele User Account email address must be all lowercase; otherwise, it will result in authentication failures.
- The password should not contain any special characters. Even though it works in the Miele app, it may not work with the API.
- Allow a couple of minutes to get the activation email. All changes in the developer portal take a couple of minutes before the change is implemented.

{% details "I have manually disabled My Home Assistant" %}

If you don't have [My Home Assistant](/integrations/my) on your installation,
you can use `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>/auth/external/callback` as the redirect URI
instead.

The `<HOME_ASSISTANT_URL>` must be the same as used during the configuration/
authentication process.

Internal examples: `http://192.168.0.2:8123/auth/external/callback`, `http://homeassistant.local:8123/auth/external/callback`.

{% enddetails %}

{% include integrations/config_flow.md %}

The integration configuration will ask for the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* created above. See [Application Credentials](/integrations/application_credentials) for more details.

## Supported functionality

{% note %}

- The entities' availability depends on the appliance type and the generation of the product, and the appliance might not support all the entities for its type.
- Products from professional and semi-professional series are generally not supported due to the limitations in the Miele 3rd party API.
- Some appliances don't report data while they are turned off, so corresponding entities will not appear in the Miele integration after loading until the appliances are turned on.
{% endnote %}

### Sensor

{% details "List of sensors" %}

- **Operation state**:
  - **Status**: Represents the current operation state of the device. The default entity name is just the appliance type e.g., "Dishwasher".
  - **Temperature**: Represents the current temperature in refrigerators, freezers and ovens. Entities are created for up to 3 zones depending on the device capabilities.
{% enddetails %}

## Automation examples

Get started with these automation examples

### Send a notification when the appliance ends the program

{% details "Example YAML configuration" %}

{% raw %}

```yaml
alias: "Notify when program ends"
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id:
      - sensor.washing_machine
    to: program_ended
actions:
  - service: notify.notify
    data:
      message: "The appliance has finished the program."
```

{% endraw %}
{% enddetails %}

## Data updates

This integration uses server-sent events from the Miele API to receive live updates from the appliances.
When the configuration entry is loaded or after a streaming error (for example after disconnection), the integration will request all data (such as appliance info, available commands, programs, settings, and status) for all appliances.
If a new appliance is added to the account, the integration will request data for the new appliance and expose the related entities automatically after a reload of the integration.

## Known limitations

- The Miele 3rd party API does not fully match the Miele app. Some programs, options, or settings available in the app may not be accessible or usable via the API.
- This integration supports only one integration entry, as the Miele 3rd party API does not allow for the unique identification of an account.

## Troubleshooting

### Unavailable entities for a device

#### Symptom: "The entities related to an appliance were available but no longer are"

After reloading the Miele integration, the entities related to an appliance that used to be available are no longer available.
Also, when downloading the diagnostics data from the device page, the technical data is obtained:

##### Description

Unavailable entities can have multiple causes:

- The appliance is turned off. When it is turned off, the appliance is disconnected and the API does not retrieve information about the appliance.
- The appliance is experiencing a network issue.
- The Miele API is experiencing issues.

##### Solution

To try to solve the above issues, follow these steps:

1. Turn on the appliance and reload the Miele integration.
2. If the appliance is turned on and the issue persists, check the network connection of the appliance and perform a soft reset on the appliance.
3. If the issue persists, check the connection of the appliance with the Miele API by checking it in the Miele app.
   1. Open the Miele app.
   2. Go to the appliance that is experiencing the issue.
   3. Press the cog-wheel to view more information.
4. If everything is correct and the issue persists, contact Miele support.
